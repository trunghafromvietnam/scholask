Except **Canadian citizens**, international students must hold an **F-1** visa to study in the U.S.

### Acceptance Materials & I-20
- Digital packet includes housing/orientation/testing/pre-arrival and the **SEVIS I-20**.  
- Keep the **same I-20** throughout your stay; can only be provided to student/dependents/parents (if minor).

### Apply for F-1 (after receiving I-20)
1) Review acceptance packet; verify bio/major/program dates; **sign I-20** (parent/guardian if <18).  
2) Pay **SEVIS I-901 fee** (keep receipt).  
3) Complete **DS-160** and **schedule visa interview** (apply up to **365 days** before program start).  
4) Prepare for interview: bring passport, I-20, financials, acceptance; be concise and clear in English; show ties home, funding sufficiency, full-time study intent.

If denied: ask for written reason; what to improve; review documents; attempt again.

### Change of Status (in U.S.)
- Apply **before** current status expires; processing **~60 days to 9+ months**.  
- If **approved**: begin full-time study next term. If **denied**: prepare to depart per instructions.  
- **Approval ≠ visa**. If leaving U.S. later, you must obtain an **F-1 visa** at a U.S. consulate to re-enter.

### Entry to U.S.
- Can enter up to **30 days** before I-20 start date; bring passport (≥6 months validity), F-1 visa, **I-20**, **SEVIS fee** receipt, financials, and acceptance docs.
