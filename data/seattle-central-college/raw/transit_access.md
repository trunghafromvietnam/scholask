- Campus is steps from **Light Rail** and multiple **Metro bus** routes on/near Broadway.  
- For **real-time arrivals & service alerts**, use official **OneBusAway** (Puget Sound) apps/API.  
- Scholask integrates a **Transit widget** that lists nearby stops and ETA; when offline, it shows static routes only.

> For RAG, keep high-level guidance here. Real-time ETAs come from the live Transit service, not from RAG.
